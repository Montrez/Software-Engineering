* Write a paragraph explaining the rationale behind your prioritization. You don’t have to explain every single US, but should give some general idea why some are prioritized higher.

  * The priorization is based on the flow of the project. User will have to first sign up and then sign in to our API, and then the user will be granted the right to make a group and make ia thread in the group, etc. Sign up has the most priority because even though it might be the easiest method to implement, but without signing up an account, the user would not do much with our API.

* Estimate the size of each user story with story points and place the value in the table above. Write a paragraph explaining the technique you used to determine your story point estimates. Also explain the difference in points between at least two user stories of your choice

  * The technique that we used is Fibonacci Sequence with the story points of 1 2 3 5 8 12 20...The reason why we used this method was because with the financci sequence increases, the number gaps increase too. It clearly differential the difficulty levels. For example, we gave sign up a story point of 2 and view feed a story point of 5. It clearly differential the complexities of these two methods.
